All of these challenges are provided by my Bachelors.
I've created this repo with the purpose of archiving all my solutions to these challenges.

Although most of my answers are right, some of the answers aren't, or not fully.
So, if you're here to shamelessly grab one of my solutions, at least see if it works as intended.

Also, some of the code of my old answers is pretty bad tbh, but I'm keeping it that way so that I can have a record about my coding progress.
